Ninja introduction
===

__The author has to prepare for the final exam, so MAYBE pause updates__.

Basically Ninja is a simple web browser like any other, but there are some different things you need to know:

### Custom home:

 - On the applications first start, home page shows as `about:blank`.

 - Use the overflow menu's __Add to home__ to pin webpages to Homepage.

 - Use the overflow menu's __Relayout__ to customize your homepage layout.

 - __Long press__ on a card on the homepage, and you can edit the title.

## Switch tabs:

 - You can set tab switcher position to be at the __screen top or screen bottom__ at `Settings/Browser/Omnibox Position`.

 - Press the __address bar__ and __drag it down or up__, then the fashion tab switcher will display.

 - __Swipe up/down__ to dimiss a page.

 - Or just __swipe the omnibox left/right__ to swicth tabs :)

The __Settings__ is located in the top or bottom left of tab switcher, the __gear__ icon.

__Remember__ that if the soft keyboard is shown the tab switcher would not display, it's our design :)

## Load in background when you click links in other App:

 1. Set Ninja as your __default browser__ when the link is clicked.

 2. __Single tap__ will open the links in the background, and show a clickable notification in the statusbar.

 3. __Double tap__ will show a dialog that allows you to open links in foreground, etc.

## Volume control:

In `Settings/Browser/Volume control` you can set the volume keys behavior to:

 - Switch tabs.

 - Scroll webpages.

 - System default.

## AdBlock whitelist:

Since AdBlock maybe cause some websites display error, you can add those websites to the whitelist `Settings/AdBlock/Whitelist`.

## Readability:

Ninja supports read mode but it needs __Readability API Token__.

To get the token you should go to [Readability Developer APIs](https://www.readability.com/developers/api "Readability Developer APIs") and set it in `Settings/Readability/Token`.

## Screenshot:

Ninja can __capture entire webpages__!

But that does not mean you could screenshot a very long webpage which may cause the browser to go __Out of Memory__.
