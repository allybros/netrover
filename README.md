NetRover is a free web browser for Android which stands on privacy.

Basically NetRover is a simple web browser like any other, but there are some different things you need to know:

Use the overflow menu's Add to home to pin webpages to Homepage.
Use the overflow menu's Relayout to customize your homepage layout.
Long press on a card on the homepage, and you can edit the title.

# Switch tabs
Press the address bar and drag it down or up, then the fashion tab switcher will display.
Swipe up/down to dimiss a page.

Since AdBlock maybe cause some websites display error, you can add those websites to the whitelist Settings/AdBlock/Whitelist.

# Screenshots
NetRover can capture entire webpages!
But that does not mean you could screenshot a very long webpage which may cause the browser to go Out of Memory
